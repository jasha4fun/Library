# LibraryJS_aplication
Library management system, allowing you to add, delete, edit data, update books, games, movies etc. in the library. For operations on variables, the application uses most Java elements and functions such as variables, classes and objects, methods and constructors, access specifiers, control structures, arrays and loops. This is my first application written while learning from the JavaStart course. Along with the progress in learning and detecting errors in the program, I am updating to improve and expand the project. I write all projects in IntelliJ IDEA CE. 

Test it, try it and give me feedback what can I change and improve.
